I am 41 years old and have been happily married since 2011. We have 3 children aged 10, 8 and 2. In my free time I really enjoy working with computers. This includes assembling the hardware and programming websites. Since I used to skateboard a lot, I also really enjoy playing computer games that deal with this topic. I am a cheerful and funny person who enjoys being involved in a team. I have a lot of fun at work when the processes are structured and I can complete my tasks according to this plan. I am also happy to provide creative solutions to a problem. In my current area of ​​responsibility, a lot is about the topic of automation. I would like to further expand this knowledge in the area of ​​programming or automation.
